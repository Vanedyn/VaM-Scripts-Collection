# Enhanced deskop mode
 *Note*: I didn't test this with any VR headset / controllers
 
## Installation
 * Copy the files `Assembly-CSharp.dll` to `<VirtAMate>\VaM_Data\Managed`
 * Create a backup of it first

## Uninstall
 * Restore the `Assembly-CSharp.dll`  to your backup or the backup from the Backup Folder `<VirtAMate>\VaM_Data\Managed`
 * This backup is from `VaM 1.17.7.1` only
 
## Features
  *Tired of offsetUI*: The UI will not rotate with the camera in the horizontal axis.
 *New camera rotation*: Camera rotates around itself and you can only focus on the objects while holding `F` and the right mouse button.
 *Move objects in the Z axis*: Just like when you rotate objects with `LCtrl` or `LShift`, this allow you to drag objects in the zx plane while holding alt
 *ScrollWheel disabled*: Isn't disabled, it just only work while holding `F` key and rotating camera
